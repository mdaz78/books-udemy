# React & Redux Learning Project

A comprehensive React and Redux application built while completing Stephen Grider's "Modern React with Redux" course on Udemy. This project demonstrates practical implementation of modern React patterns, state management with Redux, and full-stack development concepts.

## 🚀 Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

### Frontend Technologies

- **React 19** - Latest React features and hooks
- **Redux** - State management and predictable state updates
- **JavaScript ES6+** - Modern JavaScript features
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API requests
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server

### Development Tools

- **ESLint** - Code linting and quality assurance
- **JSON Server** - Mock API for development
- **Git** - Version control and project management

## 📚 Course Learning Outcomes

This project represents hands-on experience with:

- **React Fundamentals**

  - Component-based architecture
  - JSX and virtual DOM
  - Props and state management
  - Lifecycle methods and hooks

- **Redux State Management**

  - Actions, reducers, and store
  - Middleware implementation
  - Time-travel debugging
  - Predictable state updates

- **Modern Development Practices**
  - Component composition and reusability
  - Performance optimization techniques
  - Error handling and debugging
  - Testing strategies
